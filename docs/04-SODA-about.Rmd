# SODA Reanalysis Data

**About:**

The Simple Ocean Data Assimilation ocean/sea ice reanalysis (SODA) dataset was used as our reference dataset for three environmental variables: 1.) Sea Surface Salinity, 2.) Seafloor Temperature, & 3.) Seafloor Salinity.

## Accessing Data

SODA monthly data were downloaded as annual NetCDF files from the [University of Maryland](https://www2.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/index_files/soda3.4.2_mn_download_b.htm) server, using their linux "wget" commands. 


## Data Preparation

Once downloaded, additional steps were taken to extract values for surface and bottom measurements. Variables (surface/bottom temperature and salinity) were then stored as separate files in preparation for the bias-correction processing steps.
